# MoviesProject - with Redux
The purpose of the site is to link movies and their dates to cinema subscribers. This is an administrative site in order to create order for the cinema workers and allow them to see the information in an orderly manner.
The site is a FullStack project utilizing a mongoDb database, a server built with Node.js, and FrontEnd implemented with React and Bootstrap for design. The server uses JWT for data security. The FrontEnd employs Redux for data storage, optimizing site performance by reducing requests to the server.
